## About

I have always loved planning web-apps like Trello due to their simplicity, however I just don't find any of
them particularly pleasing aesthetically, and there is also the downside of the big ones not being open-source.
Because of this, I wanted to create my own solution that is fast, secure and easy to use, but also elegant and beautiful.
